## Description
In this directory, we are going to learn about or rather introduce SQL (Structured Query Language). Which is the language widely use to manage databases.
We are going to focus particularly on relational databases.

### Definitions

#### What is a relational database?
A relational database is a database where data are store into tables and those table can be linked to one another using relations.

### What is a DBMS(Database Management System)?
DBMS is a collection of progrmas which enables its users to access database, manipulate data and help in presentation of data.

### SQL
SQL is the language used to communicate with databases.
SQL statements are broadly divided into two main categories which are, DDL and DML
- DDL(Data Definition Language) statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and objects in the database.
  Most DDL statements will most of the time have one of these SQL keyword: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `SHOW`.
- DML(Data Manipulation Language) statements are used to work with the data in tables.
  Most DML statements will most of the time have one of the SQL keywords: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, 'DELETE`, `SELECT`.
